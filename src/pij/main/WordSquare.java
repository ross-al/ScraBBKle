public class WordSquare {

    //Premium word squares also have an integer number of at least -9 and at most 99
    //as a factor (specifically, 0 or negative values are possible). When a move places a
    //tile on a premium word square, the factor of the premium word square will be
    //multiplied with the score obtained for the word otherwise. If a move uses several
    //premium letter squares, the effect is cumulative (for example, when we use a
    //premium word square with factor 4 and a second premium word square with factor 5
    //in the same move, the resulting factor for the word score would be 4*5 = 20).
    //Premium word squares are applied only after premium letter squares. A premium
    //word square has the shape {x} if the factor x is a single character and the shape {xy
    //if the factor xy has two characters.
