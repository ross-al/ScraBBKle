    //do we need a class for this?
    //or can we use an array/map? e.g. when board is created or loaded
    //if square meets shape criteria then it is a letter square (same logic for word square)
    //then when scoring we just check if square is in array/map?



    //Premium letter squares have an integer number of at least -9 and at most 99 as
    //a factor (specifically, 0 or negative values are possible). When a tile is placed on a
    //premium letter square, the score for the tile is its value multiplied by the factor of
    //the premium letter square. A premium letter square has the shape (x) if the factor x
    //is a single character and the shape (xy if the factor xy has two characters.
